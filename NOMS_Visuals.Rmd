#each NOMS assessment topic area (except for the NOMS sub-scale used for evaluation study question 2.00) will have two visuals, which will show: 1) the averages and the distributions at both initial and discharge time points, and 2) the percentages of those who selected ratings of 4 or higher (indicating the positive outcome) across the sub-scale item(s) at initial and discharge time points.

#the first report out will use a ridgeline plot to visualize across the different versions (caregiver self-report, caregiver report on youth, and youth self-report) as well as overall (all versions): <https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2021/12/19/comparing-distributions/>

#the second report out will use a dumbbell plot to visualize across the different versions (caregiver self-report, caregiver report on youth, and youth self-report) as well as overall (all versions): <https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-dumbbell-chart-with-a-gap-column.html>
