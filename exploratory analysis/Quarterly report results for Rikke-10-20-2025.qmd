## Outcomes Data by Round

### Participants Served

**Data used**: Discharge data, which includes 338 clients that had more than one complete intervention.

**Nitty gritty cleaning**: took out DEMO data; checked to see which `client_ids` had `pre_measure_s` AND `post_measure_s` per row (i.e., had a complete intervention); left those in; filtered for `intervention_start <= "2025-09-30"`

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
discharge_data_filtered <- read_csv("/Users/cristin/Dropbox/Rebecca and Tristan and Cristin/EInsight Data/discharge_data_clean.csv")
discharge_data_filtered <- discharge_data_filtered %>% 
  filter(intervention_start <= "2025-09-30")
  
part_served <- table(discharge_data_filtered$funding_round)
part_served

```

### Improved outcomes

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: false
library(janitor)
# number of rows in discharge data 
nrow(discharge_data_filtered)

# number of rows with positive_outcomes != NA
count_pos <- nrow(discharge_data_filtered %>% filter(!is.na(positive_outcomes)))
count_pos

# table of positive outcomes 
tab <- discharge_data_filtered %>%
  tabyl(positive_outcomes) %>%               
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1)
tab

# percent of positive outcomes
yes_pct <- tab %>%
  filter(positive_outcomes == "Yes") %>%
  pull(valid_percent)
```

Out of `{r} nrow(discharge_data_filtered)` rows of clients in EInsight's discharge data dashboard, `{r} count_pos` had both a pre- and post-score. Of those clients with complete intervention data in EInsight, `{r} yes_pct` had a positive outcome.

The results below show % of positive outcomes by round, once NA's are removed from the data.

**Nitty gritty**: Positive outcome was defined as \[ this needs to be confirmed with Rebecca/Steve; this is a column from EInsight and I believe is just defined as "Is the post-score lower/higher than the pre-score, based on the relevant assessment scoring metrics given to Steve's team"\].

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# table of positive outcomes by funding round
tab2 <- discharge_data_filtered %>% 
  filter(!is.na(positive_outcomes)) %>% 
  tabyl(positive_outcomes, funding_round) %>% 
  adorn_totals("row") %>% 
  adorn_percentages("col") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>%
  adorn_ns()

Satisfaction is defined two ways below. The first is the percent of individuals who answered question 1 as "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" on the satisfaction survey. The second definition is the percent of individuals who selected "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" on 80% or more of the questions completed.

**Nitty gritty:** There are four satisfaction surveys: Caregiver (n=`{r} nrow(caregiver)`), Child (13-17) (n=`{r} nrow(child)`), Adult (18-59) (n=`{r} nrow(adult)`), and Adult (60+) (n=`{r} nrow(senior)`). A separate data frame was made for question 1, and high satisfaction was defined as the percent of individuals who answered a 4 or 5 for question 1.

#### Question 1 Satisfaction

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: false
combined_q1 <- bind_rows(
  caregiver %>% 
    select(provider, provider_id, provider_system_id, client_system_id, collection, cps_id, 
           date_completed, matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    rename(q1 = matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    mutate(source = "caregiver"),
  child %>% 
    select(provider, provider_id, provider_system_id, client_system_id, collection, cps_id, 
           date_completed, matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    rename(q1 = matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    mutate(source = "child"),
  adult %>% 
    select(provider, provider_id, provider_system_id, client_system_id, collection, cps_id, 
           date_completed, matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    rename(q1 = matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    mutate(source = "adult"),
  senior %>% 
    select(provider, provider_id, provider_system_id, client_system_id, collection, cps_id, 
           date_completed, matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    rename(q1 = matches("^x1_")) %>% 
    mutate(source = "senior"))
combined_q1 <- combined_q1 %>% 
  filter(date_completed <= "2025-09-30")
```

The following is the % of high satisfaction by source:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

combined_q1 %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  summarise(
    n_total = sum(!is.na(q12)),
    n_4_5 = sum(q12 %in% c(4, 5), na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_4_5 = round((100 * n_4_5 / n_total), 1)
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: false
pct_4_5 <- combined_q1 %>%
  summarise(
    pct_4_5 = round((100 * sum(q12 %in% c(4, 5), na.rm = TRUE) / sum(!is.na(q12))), 1)
  ) %>%
  pull(pct_4_5)

pct_4_5
```

Overall, `{r} pct_4_5`% of survey respondents were highly satisfied based on question 1 answers. The following table shows high survey satisfaction by round.

```{r}

#### Combined Survey Satisfaction

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: false

summary_agree <- combined_all %>%
  # keep only question columns
  select(q2, q4, q6, q8, q10, q12, q14) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(.))) %>% 
  # calculate per-person proportion of "Agree"/"Strongly Agree"
  rowwise() %>%
  summarise(
    n_answered = sum(!is.na(c_across(everything()))),
    n_agree = sum(c_across(everything()) %in% c(4, 5)),
    pct_agree = n_agree / n_answered
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarise(
    n_total = n(),

    pct_meeting_80pct = round((100 * n_meeting_80pct / n_total), 1)
  )

summary_agree
```

Overall, `{r} summary_agree$pct_meeting_80pct`% of survey respondents were highly satisfied, defined as selecting "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" on 80% or more of the questions completed, for those who completed a survey on or before September 30, 2025.

The following table shows high survey satisfaction results by funding round, for data where both client_id and `funding_round` were available.

```{r}
#| echo: false

summary_agree <- combined_round %>%

### Successful discharges

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: false
# number of rows with a reason for discharge
count_rows <- nrow(discharge_data_filtered %>% filter(!is.na(reason_for_discharge)))

# number of rows with successful discharge
# table of positive outcomes 
tab3 <- discharge_data_filtered %>%
  tabyl(reason_for_discharge) %>%               
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0)
tab3

# count of successful discharge
yes_count <- tab3 %>%
  filter(reason_for_discharge == "Mutually agreed cessation of treatment (Successful Completion)") %>%
  pull(n)
yes_count

# percent of successful discharge
yes_pct3 <- tab3 %>%
  filter(reason_for_discharge == "Mutually agreed cessation of treatment (Successful Completion)") %>%
  pull(valid_percent)
yes_pct3
```

Successful discharges were defined as those clients that had "Mutually agreed cessation of treatment (Successful Completion)" as the `reason_for_discharge` in the discharge data from EInsight. Of `{r} nrow(discharge_data_filtered)` rows of discharge data, `{r} count_rows` rows had a reason for discharge stated. Of individuals with a reason for discharge stated, `{r} yes_count` (`{r} yes_pct3`) were successfully discharged.

The results below show % of successful discharges by round, once NA's are removed from the data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# total table of successful discharges by funding round
tab4 <- discharge_data_filtered %>% 
  filter(!is.na(reason_for_discharge)) %>% 
  tabyl(reason_for_discharge, funding_round) %>% 
  adorn_totals("row") %>% 
  adorn_percentages("col") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>%
  adorn_ns() 
tab4
```
